Hello and welcome to StockNix!

StockNix nixes stock parts, to unclutter the VAB when functionally equivalent mods are installed.

Nixed Parts:
* Rocket engines and fuel tanks (for use with KWRocketry)
* Fairings (for use with OSFairings)

This mod makes parts unavailable, so existing craft may be deleted.

DO NOT USE WITH EXISTING SAVES!

Install into your GameData folder. Requires ModuleManager.
